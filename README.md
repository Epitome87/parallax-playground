# Parallax Playground

This is a very quick and simple webpage where I create and test parallax effects -- purely for practice.
Using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, a parallax effect is established on various elements of the webpage
by simply re-calculating their positions based on the user's scrolling.

My main goal with this project is to strengthen the foundations of my web development knowledge.

## Accessing the Webpage

You can view the resulting [webpage](https://epitome87.github.io/parallax-playground/) via Git Pages!
To share the page with others, you can copy and paste the following:

## ðŸ”§ Still Under Construction ðŸ”§

Currently, the webpage is _not_ mobile-friendly!
